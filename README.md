# Project on Style Transfer
<p>In this project we used the concept of deep learning and neural networks to copy the style of one image to another image and thus forming a third output image. Neural style transfer was implemented by  Leon A. Gatys, Alexander S. Ecker, and Matthias Bethge. </p>
<p>Here is an eg. of the style transfer</p>
